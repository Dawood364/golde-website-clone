# Golde Website Clone

This project is a clone of the Golde website, built using **HTML and CSS**.  
I enhanced the clone by adding a video section showcasing product highlights.

## Features

- Responsive design mimicking the original Golde site
- Video integration for product demos
- Clean and modern UI

## How to View

Open `index.html` in your browser to see the site locally.
